A project that I have worked on called Solo Resume. Originally written in Noir and currently converting it over to Compojure. The conversion is not complete yet, but it will be updated and completed shortly. The intent is to serve it as a demo project that others can use for reference when they get stuck. Furhter documentation can be added as needed or upon request. 

You can find the site (Noir Version) at www.soloresume.com
